# Resume-Generator (2020)
A Resume generator based on HTML and PHP that stores data in an SQL database 

The idea was to create a web site that could create a resume for you just by adding the informations and it would generate it automaticcaly.
The site in itself is build on HTML-CSS and uses PHP to change dynamically some parts of the page. 

To do that, the informations of the users are stored on an SQL server and the web-site then fetch these data to create the resume.
To generate it, we used the fpdf library otherwise the layout would have been impossible.
